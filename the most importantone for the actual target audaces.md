## **THE PROBLEM-AWARE COACH DIARY ENTRIES**

### **Entry 1: Before Finding Pro-G**
**November 15th, 2024 - 11:47 PM**

Another 14-hour day. Another dollar short of where I want to be.

I'm sitting here in my home office, surrounded by the chaos that my "business" has become. Three different spreadsheets open on my laptop—one for client workouts, one for nutrition plans, one for payment tracking. My phone has seventeen different apps that I've downloaded to try to make this work better. None of them talk to each other. None of them do exactly what I need.

Today I spent four hours creating workout plans. Four hours. That's four hours I could have been actually coaching, or creating content, or spending time with my family. But instead, I'm copying and pasting exercises from old Word documents, adjusting rep schemes in Excel, and formatting everything to look professional enough to send to clients who are paying me good money.

Sarah (my 6 AM client) messaged me today asking why her workout plan doesn't have video demonstrations. Valid question. I scrambled to find YouTube links for each exercise and sent them separately. Professional? Hardly. But it's the best I can do with my current "system"—if you can even call this patchwork of tools and manual processes a system.

The worst part isn't the time. It's the stress. The constant background anxiety that I'm forgetting something important. Did I update Jenny's program after her shoulder injury? Did I send Mark his new macros? When was the last time I checked in with Amanda who's been radio silent for a week?

I have a spreadsheet to track my spreadsheets. Let that sink in.

Today a potential client asked me about my "platform" and whether it had a mobile app. I had to explain that they'd get their workouts via email and track everything in MyFitnessPal. I could hear the disappointment in her voice. She went with someone else—probably someone with better systems.

I'm good at coaching. Really good. My clients get incredible results. But I'm drowning in administration. I'm working harder than I ever did at my corporate job, making less money, and constantly feeling like I'm one missed email away from losing a client.

The successful coaches I see online make it look so easy. Clean graphics, professional delivery, seamless client experiences. Meanwhile, I'm over here manually calculating macros and creating workouts in Times New Roman because I can't figure out how to change the font in Excel.

I know there has to be a better way. There has to be software designed for coaches like me. But every solution I've found is either too expensive, too basic, or built for big gyms instead of solo coaches.

I can't keep scaling myself. I'm the bottleneck in my own business. And if something doesn't change soon, I'm going to burn out completely.

Tomorrow I'm going to spend another hour researching coaching software. Again. Maybe this time I'll find something that actually works.

But honestly? I'm not holding my breath.

### **Entry 2: First Week with Pro-G**
**November 28th, 2024 - 7:15 PM**

I think I found it.

Two weeks ago, I was complaining about the chaos in my coaching business. Today, I just onboarded three new clients in the time it used to take me to create one workout plan.

Pro-G isn't perfect—no software is—but it's the first platform that feels like it was built by someone who actually understands what coaches like me need.

The onboarding was surprisingly smooth. Instead of overwhelming me with a thousand features I don't need, it walked me through setting up my core offerings step by step. The "Collection Builder" is genius—I created my signature "Strength Foundations" program once, and now I can assign it to any client with a few clicks. No more recreating the same workout templates over and over.

But here's what really got me: the client experience is actually professional. When I send someone their workout, they don't get a PDF attachment that they have to print out or save on their phone. They get access to a clean, branded app experience with video demonstrations, progress tracking, and everything they need in one place.

Maria, one of my long-term clients, texted me yesterday: "This new app is amazing! I can actually see my progress over time and the videos make sure I'm doing everything right." That text was worth the monthly subscription fee right there.

The admin dashboard gives me a real-time view of my entire business. I can see who's crushing their workouts, who needs a check-in, and who might be at risk of dropping off. Instead of playing detective with scattered spreadsheets, I have actual data about client engagement.

I'm not spending my evenings copying and pasting exercises anymore. I'm not stressed about forgetting to follow up with clients. The system handles the routine stuff, which frees me up to focus on what I'm actually good at—coaching.

I've already started creating my second program—a nutrition-focused collection for clients who want more meal planning support. The template system makes it easy to build once and deploy to multiple clients.

For the first time in months, I feel like I'm running a real business instead of just hustling harder every day.

There's still a learning curve, and I have feature requests (better integration with my email marketing would be nice), but this feels sustainable in a way that my previous setup never did.

I actually had time to work out myself today. When's the last time I could say that?

---

### **Entry 3: Three Months Later**
**February 20th, 2025 - 6:30 AM**

I just hit a milestone I honestly wasn't sure was possible six months ago: 50 active clients.

Fifty. And I'm working fewer hours than when I had 15 clients.

The difference is systems. Real, professional systems that scale.

This morning I woke up to notifications that three clients completed their workouts yesterday, two left feedback about feeling stronger, and one just hit a major weight loss goal. All of this information came to me automatically—no chasing, no manual check-ins, no wondering if people are following through.

The "Hydra-Sync" feature has been a game-changer for my group programs. I can update a workout template and it instantly pushes to all clients using that program. When I discovered that Jenny's shoulder injury required modifying some overhead movements, I updated the template once and it automatically adjusted for all five clients in that program phase.

But the real transformation isn't in the features—it's in how I think about my business.

I'm not just a coach anymore. I'm building a coaching system. My "Strength Foundations" collection has become my signature offering. New clients get a consistent, proven experience instead of whatever I happened to throw together that week. I have data showing that clients who complete the full 12-week program have a 94% success rate in hitting their initial goals.

The financial impact has been dramatic. I raised my prices 40% because I can now deliver a premium experience that justifies premium pricing. My client retention is at 89% because the platform makes it easy for people to stay consistent and see progress.

Yesterday I had a consultation call with a potential client who said she was choosing me specifically because of the professional platform experience. She'd worked with two other online coaches who used email and PDFs, and it felt "amateur" compared to what I could offer.

I'm building programs now instead of just writing workouts. My "Busy Professional" collection is almost ready to launch—a 16-week system specifically designed for time-crunched clients. Once it's built, I can serve that entire demographic without recreating everything from scratch.

The craziest part? I actually turned down three potential clients last week because my calendar is full. I referred them to other coaches and collected referral fees. That's a problem I never thought I'd have.

I'm not saying Pro-G is magic. I still have to do the actual coaching. But it's given me the infrastructure to scale my expertise instead of just trading time for money.

For the first time since starting my business, I feel like I'm building something that could eventually run without me being personally involved in every detail. That's freedom I didn't even know I was missing.

Tonight I'm having dinner with my family without thinking about which clients I need to email or what workouts I need to create. The system is handling the routine stuff.

This is what running a real business feels like.

### **Objection Handling Guide:**

**"It's too expensive"**
→ "What's it costing you to manually create workouts, chase client check-ins, and deliver programs through email? Most coaches save 15+ hours per week and can serve 3x more clients. The platform pays for itself with just 2-3 additional clients."

**"My clients are happy with what I provide now"**
→ "That's great that you're delivering results! The question is: how many potential clients are you losing because competitors offer a more professional experience? And how much time could you save while keeping your current clients even happier?"

**"I don't want to learn new software"**
→ "I understand—you became a coach to coach, not to become a tech expert. That's exactly why we built this to be intuitive. Most coaches are fully operational within a week, and our onboarding team walks you through everything."

**"What if I want to leave the platform?"**
→ "You own all your data and can export everything at any time. But let me ask—what's your plan for scaling your business with your current tools? Most coaches find they outgrow basic solutions within 6-12 months anyway."
