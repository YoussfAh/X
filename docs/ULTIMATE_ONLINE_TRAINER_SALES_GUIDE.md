## üéØ PART IX: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
### Every Concern Addressed

---

### üí∞ INVESTMENT & ROI QUESTIONS

**Q: "The monthly cost seems high compared to other platforms."**
**A:** Pro-G isn't just a platform‚Äîit's a complete business transformation system. While competitors charge $50-100/month for basic features, Pro-G delivers enterprise-grade capabilities that typically cost $5,000+ to build custom. Our clients average 5-10X revenue increases within 6 months, making Pro-G the highest-ROI investment in their business.

**Q: "What if I can't afford the monthly payment right now?"**
**A:** We offer a 90-day success guarantee. If Pro-G doesn't increase your revenue enough to cover the investment within 90 days, we'll refund your money and let you keep the platform. Most trainers see ROI within 30 days.

**Q: "Are there any hidden fees or additional costs?"**
**A:** No hidden fees. Your monthly subscription includes everything: hosting, security, updates, support, and all features. The only additional cost would be custom development for unique requirements (Enterprise+ only).

---

### üîß TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

**Q: "What if the platform goes down or has technical issues?"**
**A:** Pro-G maintains 99.9% uptime with enterprise-grade infrastructure. We have automatic failover systems, daily backups, and 24/7 monitoring. In the unlikely event of an issue, our technical team resolves problems within minutes, not hours.

**Q: "Can I export my data if I ever want to leave?"**
**A:** Absolutely. You own your data 100%. We provide complete data export tools and will assist with migration to any other platform. However, most trainers find Pro-G so valuable they never want to leave.

**Q: "How secure is my client data?"**
**A:** Pro-G uses bank-level security with encryption, regular security audits, and compliance with GDPR and HIPAA regulations. Your client data is more secure on Pro-G than on your own computer.

---

### üìà BUSINESS QUESTIONS

**Q: "I'm already using [Trainerize/MyFitnessPal/etc.]. Why should I switch?"**
**A:** Those platforms were built for individual users, not professional trainers. Pro-G was designed from the ground up for coaching businesses. The difference is like comparing a bicycle to a Tesla‚Äîboth get you places, but one transforms your entire experience.

**Q: "What if my clients don't like the new platform?"**
**A:** In our experience, 95%+ of clients prefer Pro-G over spreadsheets, WhatsApp, or basic fitness apps. The professional experience actually increases client retention and allows you to charge higher prices. We provide complete client transition support to ensure smooth adoption.

**Q: "Can I really scale to 100+ clients without hiring more staff?"**
**A:** Yes. Pro-G's automation handles most administrative tasks, and the streamlined client management allows you to serve far more clients with the same time investment. Many of our trainers manage 200+ clients working fewer hours than they did with 20 clients on manual systems.
