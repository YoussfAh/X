ENVIRONMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a file named ".env" in your backend directory (backend/.env)

2. Add the following lines to the file:

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=964978895875899
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=lLRtD275cAzvJVcJpAeQCaL_nbk
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dgqwtzgwo

3. Save the file

4. Restart your server by:
   - First, find and terminate any running server processes using port 5000
   - Then start the server with: npm run backend

Note: It's best practice to never commit your .env file to version control.
The credentials are added as fallbacks in the code, but they should ideally be kept only in the .env file.
