CLOUDINARY ENVIRONMENT SETUP

Please add the following variables to your .env file in the backend directory:

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=964978895875899
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=lLRtD275cAzvJVcJpAeQCaL_nbk
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dgqwtzgwo
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=grindx-upload

These settings ensure:
1. All Cloudinary configuration is read from environment variables
2. No hardcoded values exist in the code
3. You can easily update your Cloudinary settings when deploying to different environments
4. The system will validate that all required variables are present before attempting uploads

When deploying to production, simply update these values in your production environment
with the new Cloudinary credentials, and everything will work without code changes.
