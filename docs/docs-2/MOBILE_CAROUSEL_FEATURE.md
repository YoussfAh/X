## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:
1. Navigate to `/admin/system-settings`
2. In the carousel management section, each slide now has two image sections:
   - **Desktop Image**: The main image for desktop/tablet views
   - **Mobile Image (Optional)**: Optimized image for phone screens
3. Upload mobile images with taller aspect ratios (like 9:16) for better phone display
4. If no mobile image is provided, the desktop image will be used on all devices

### Technical Details:
- Mobile detection: `window.innerWidth <= 768`
