## 🔒 **ENDPOINT SECURITY MATRIX**

### **PRODUCT API ENDPOINTS** - `/api/products`

| Endpoint | Method | Before Security | After Security | User Access | Admin Access |
|----------|--------|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| `/api/products` | GET | 🔴 **PUBLIC** | ✅ **PROTECTED** | Limited (20/page, rate limited) | Full access |
| `/api/products` | POST | ✅ Admin Only | ✅ **PROTECTED** | ❌ Blocked | Create products |
| `/api/products/top` | GET | 🔴 **PUBLIC** | ✅ **PROTECTED** | Limited (3 items, rate limited) | Full access |
| `/api/products/:id` | GET | 🔴 **PUBLIC** | ✅ **PROTECTED** | Individual product if accessible | Full access |
| `/api/products/:id` | PUT | ✅ Admin Only | ✅ **PROTECTED** | ❌ Blocked | Edit products |
| `/api/products/:id` | DELETE | ✅ Admin Only | ✅ **PROTECTED** | ❌ Blocked | Delete products |

#### **Security Implementation:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
router.route('/').get(getProducts) // ❌ PUBLIC ACCESS

// AFTER:
router.route('/').get(
  apiDataRateLimit,        // 100 requests/15min per IP
  trackDataDownloads,      // 200 requests/hour per user
  limitPageSize(20),       // Max 20 items per request
  protect,                 // JWT authentication required
  getProducts
)
```

#### **Data Protection:**
- **What was exposed:** Complete product catalog with nutrition data, instructions, pricing
- **What's now protected:** All product data requires authentication
- **Rate limits:** 100 requests per 15 minutes, 200 downloads per hour per user
- **Page limits:** Maximum 20 products per request

  getExercises
)
```

#### **Data Protection:**
- **What was exposed:** Complete exercise database with instructions, videos, difficulty levels
- **What's now protected:** All exercise data requires authentication

## 🛡️ **SECURITY MIDDLEWARE STACK**

### **Rate Limiting Middleware:**
```javascript
export const apiDataRateLimit = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,    // 15 minutes
  max: 100,                    // 100 requests per window
  message: { error: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.' }
});
```

### **Download Tracking Middleware:**
```javascript
export const trackDataDownloads = (req, res, next) => {
  const identifier = req.user?._id?.toString() || req.ip;
  const downloads = downloadTracker.get(identifier) || [];
  
  if (downloads.length >= 200) { // 200 requests per hour per user
    return res.status(429).json({
      error: 'Download limit exceeded. Please wait before requesting more data.',
      retryAfter: 3600
    });
  }
  
  downloads.push(Date.now());
  downloadTracker.set(identifier, downloads);
  next();
};
```

### **Page Size Limiting Middleware:**
```javascript
export const limitPageSize = (maxSize = 20) => (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.query.pageSize) {
    req.query.pageSize = Math.min(Number(req.query.pageSize), maxSize);
  }
  if (req.query.limit) {
    req.query.limit = Math.min(Number(req.query.limit), maxSize);
  }
  next();
};
```
