# Stagewise Integration Documentation

## Overview
Stagewise toolbar has been successfully integrated into the PRO-G frontend React application. This provides AI-powered editing capabilities through a browser toolbar that connects the frontend UI to coding AI agents in your code editor.

## Integration Details

### Packages Installed
- `@stagewise/toolbar-react`: ^0.4.9 - React-specific stagewise toolbar component
- `@stagewise-plugins/react`: ^0.4.9 - React plugin for enhanced React component detection

### Integration Location
The stagewise toolbar is integrated in the main `App.js` file at the root of the React component tree.

### Key Features
- **Development-only execution**: The toolbar only renders when `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- **Production safe**: Automatically excluded from production builds
- **React 18 compatible**: Updated integration that works with React 18 StrictMode
- **Plugin-enabled**: Includes ReactPlugin for enhanced React component detection and manipulation

### Component Structure
```javascript
function StagewiseToolbarWrapper() {
  // Only render in development mode
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development') {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <StagewiseToolbar
      config={{
        plugins: [ReactPlugin],
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### VS Code Extension
The stagewise VS Code extension is recommended in `.vscode/extensions.json` to provide the complete development experience.

## Usage
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Open the application in your browser
3. The stagewise toolbar will appear automatically in development mode
4. Use the toolbar to select elements, leave comments, and interact with AI agents
5. Make sure you have the stagewise VS Code extension installed for the complete experience

## Notes
- The toolbar is completely disabled in production builds
- No additional configuration is required for basic usage
- The integration handles React 18 StrictMode compatibility issues that were present in previous versions
