# Feature Flags Implementation - Complete Fix

## Problem Fixed
The feature flags system wasn't saving to the database properly. Users' feature flags would appear to change in the frontend but weren't persisting to the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was with how Mongoose handles nested object updates. When updating nested objects like `featureFlags`, Mongoose doesn't automatically detect changes unless explicitly told to do so.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Database Layer (userModel.js)
- Added pre-save middleware to initialize feature flags for new users
- Added post-find middleware to ensure existing users have feature flags initialized
- Proper schema definition with default values

### 2. Backend Controller Layer (userController.js)  
- Fixed `updateUser` function to:
  - Initialize feature flags object if it doesn't exist
  - Update each feature flag individually with Boolean conversion
  - Use `markModified('featureFlags')` to tell Mongoose the nested object changed
  - Added verification by re-fetching from database after save
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Added `getUserFeatureFlags` debug endpoint

### 3. Backend Routes (userRoutes.js)
- Added debug endpoint: `GET /api/users/:id/feature-flags`
- Proper authentication and admin protection

### 4. Authentication Responses
- All auth endpoints (login, register, Google auth) include feature flags
- Feature flags are included in user profile responses

## Feature Flags Available
- `uploadMealImage`: Controls meal image upload functionality
- `aiAnalysis`: Controls AI analysis feature access

## API Endpoints
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user (includes feature flags)
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user details (includes feature flags)
- `GET /api/users/:id/feature-flags` - Debug endpoint for feature flags

## Database Structure
```javascript
featureFlags: {
  uploadMealImage: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false,
  },
  aiAnalysis: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false,
  },
}
```

## Middleware for Route Protection
- `checkUploadMealImageFeature` - Protects nutrition upload routes
- `checkAiAnalysisFeature` - Protects AI analysis routes

## Testing Verified
- ✅ Feature flags save to database correctly
- ✅ Feature flags persist across server restarts
- ✅ Individual flag updates work properly
- ✅ New users get initialized feature flags
- ✅ Existing users get feature flags added if missing
- ✅ All authentication endpoints include feature flags
- ✅ Admin can update user feature flags
- ✅ Changes are immediately reflected in responses

## Deployment Ready
- Works with MongoDB Atlas
- Compatible with Vercel deployment
- Proper environment variable handling
- No additional dependencies required

## Debug Logging
Comprehensive logging added for troubleshooting:
- Feature flag updates received
- Before/after values
- Database save confirmations
- Verification queries

This implementation ensures bulletproof persistence of feature flags across the entire application stack.
